# Countdown

Countdown is a game where two players have to press their buttons and release them before the countdown finishes. The player that gets closer to zero wins. But only if the countdown hasn't passed zero yet!

# Configuration

After you clone the repository you have to add the following lines to the file `gradle.properties`:

```ini
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS      = ???
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD   = ???
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD = ???
RELEASE_STORE_FILE     = ???
```
